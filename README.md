# Summary
This application uses HTML / javascript to generate Dymo print labels via the Dymo Web SDK. This demo application was made for a particular use case in riCompro to label refurbished devices with the serial number, SKU, a document number and (an optional reference) of a 3rd party repair company. You can either reuse the existing fields or implement some of your own ;)

## Implemented Fields
This iteration contains following fields: 
1. serial: Serial Number (displayed as QR & Text on the label)
2. item: Item Code or any SKU (displayed as text on the label)
3. document: Document Number (Displayed as 128 barcode with text label below)
4. identity: Repair Company Identifier (text)

## Query Parameters
Actions such as print and values of the fields / labels can be set via query parameters:

### Example
http://yourserver/?serial=82GBPKR8798&item=ABC3DEFGHIJ32658419&document=DOC983255HJK&identity=9879133123&quantity=3&print=false

### Demo Server

1. serial=		sets the serial field, label and barcode
2. item=		sets the item code
3. document=	sets the document
4. identity=	sets the free text field at the bottom right corner of the label

#### Actions

## How are the labels generated?
Dymo uses .XML files to carry all instructions to generate and print the label inside the printer. Images are encoded as base64, while everything else is is printed based on text based xml payload.

## What is the best way to troubleshoot label sizes and / or orientation and positioning of objects?
Download the Dymo Label Writer software for Mac / Windows and design the label, afterwards safe it on your hard drive and open the .label file with a text editor. Use the .label XML as base to adjust the xml generated by the file /js/script.js . 

## How do I change the label size?
The label size can be edited in the script.js. Search for "DieCutLabel" to find the beginning of the label and look for the first draw command xml payload. 

```JavaScript
dymoLabelXml = '<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>\
                	<DrawCommands>\
                		<DieCutLabel Version="8.0" Units="twips" MediaType="Default">\
						<RoundRectangle X="0" Y="0" Width="2025" Height="5020" Rx="270" Ry="270"/>\
						<PaperOrientation>Landscape</PaperOrientation>\
                    </DrawCommands>\
```
